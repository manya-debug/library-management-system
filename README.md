A Library Management System (LMS) is a software application designed to organize, manage, and maintain the functions of a library efficiently.
It helps librarians and users manage books, track book availability, maintain borrower records, and streamline everyday library operations.
The main goal of an LMS is to reduce manual paperwork, save time, and improve accuracy in library transactions.
The system allows librarians to add new books, update book details, delete old books, and search for available books easily. 
Registered users can log in to view books, borrow and return books, and check due dates. The application records all transaction history automatically, ensuring there is no confusion about issued books or late returns. 
It also manages user information, such as student details, issued book limits, and fines for late submissions.
By using a database, the LMS stores all information in one centralized place, making data retrieval fast and secure. 
This system is useful for schools, colleges, and public libraries where large volumes of books and users must be handled regularly.
